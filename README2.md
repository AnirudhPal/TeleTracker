# AR Telescope - CS590 Independent Study under Dr. Voicu Popescu

## Index

## Abstract

We live in a time of great technological innovation. Augmented/Virtual reality lets us explore worlds right from our living rooms. However, these are just virtual constructs. We often forgot the real enviroment around us, and in this case above the us. The night sky is quite fascinating and worth exploring. Unfortunately, the modernization of the world has let to substantial amount of light pollution. If you are in a major city, you would be luck to spot more than a dozen stars. In this independent study, I attempt to explore this often underrated natural environment. I explore everything for constructing a telescope to star-pattern recognition and AR/VR integration. This multidisciplinary approach is enriching as it enabled me to integrate my academic field of computer graphics with my proffesional field of research manufacturing.

## Disclaimer

Right from the start, I wish to clarify that the information I present here is just an account of the work I did. It is by no means complete, optimal or ground-breaking. I ran into several technical challenges, some I was able to overcome, others I am still figuring out how to overcome. The biggest take-away that one can expect from this article is the telescope construction. The designs I came up with our quite a bit more mature than designs presented in other DIY articles. I use more precise industrial manufacturing tecniques and draw a lot of inspiration from the world of research optics. Although I use industrial equipment to manufacture a lot of the parts for the project, the designs are quite adaptable to desktop 3D printing. 

## Star Detection

Before we get into the weeds of actual telescope construction, design and manufacturing; lets acknowledge that when we look up in the sky, most of us can appreicate the beauty of what we are looking at but we are not as good at recognizing stars, celesetial bodies and constelations. Knowing what we are looking at can further enhance our experience and can help us navigate the night-sky. Lets look at an example:

Here we see a picture of the night-sky. We see a lot of stars, but most of us do not really recognize what we are looking at. We also miss some significant stellar objects that we have managed to capture in the frame as they are drowned out in the sea of point lights. Lets look at a processed image that was obtained by using a software tool called [Astrometry](http://astrometry.net/).
