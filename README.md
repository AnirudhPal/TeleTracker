# TeleTracker - CS590 Independent Study

## Index

> Under Construction

## Abstract

The objective of the independent study is to find a **simple and inexpensive** method of making a telescope tracking mount and studying the software and harware challenges associated with such an endeavour. The following sections cover the motivations, design aspect, software and experiments assoicated with the project.

## Motivation

Let say you wanted to take a picture of the Orion Nebula from your backyard. Even if you get a more that capable telescope for 100-200$, you will not be able to pull this off because:

1. The earth rotates at a constant rate, making the sky shift.
2. Its hard to locate a dim object in the night sky accurately.
3. Light pollution makes it difficult to see the stars and take pictures.

I wanted to address these problems by making my own tracker system which performs the following basic features:

1. Be able to locate objects in the sky.
2. Compensate for any vibrations and shifting of the sky.
3. Take long exposure shots of objects with a Raspberry Pi Camera.

Here are some pictures to illustrate this problem. They were taken by me a couple years ago from my back yard.
